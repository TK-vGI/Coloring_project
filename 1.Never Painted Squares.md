# Stage 1/6: Never Painted Squares
## Description
As a newbie to the world of spray paint, you embark on a journey to explore a canvas made up of never-painted squares.  
Wanting to understand untouched spaces, you seek information about areas that have not yet been decorated with  
vibrant colors, revealing untouched corners of this creative landscape.

## Objectives
- Identify the `id` and `name` of squares that have never been painted from the `Square` table in the coloring database.
- To determine if a square has not been painted, it must be absent in the `Painting` table.
- Ensure the results are  
  sorted by square names in descending order.
- The column order is essential.

Take a look at the following database structure:

## Explanation of the database:
The Coloring Database encompasses three main tables: painting, spray, square.

In-depth details of each table are as follows:

The `**Square**`** table represents individual squares that can be painted using spray cans. It contains the following columns:
  - `id`: A unique identifier for each square.
  - `name`: The name or label associated with the square.

The `**Spray**`** table contains information about different spray paint cans. It includes the following columns:
  - `id`: A unique identifier for each spray can. 
  - `name`: The name or label associated with the spray can.
  - `color`: The color of the spray can, is represented only by a single character ('R' for red, 'G' for green, 'B' for blue).

The `**Painting**`** table is used to track the painting activity on squares using spray cans. It includes the following columns:
  - `datetime`: The timestamp indicating when the painting occurred with an accuracy of a second, not milliseconds.
  - `square_id`: A reference to the square being painted, linking to the id column in the Square table.
  - `spray_id`: A reference to the spray can be used for painting, linking to the id column in the Spray table.
  - `volume`: The amount of paint applied during the painting process.

## Additional information and rules to consider:
- The volume of the spray can is `initially set to 255`, and it decreases as the can is used for painting.
- The color of the square is determined by the RGB rule, with (R=0, G=0, B=0) representing `black` and  
  (R=255, G=255, B=255) representing `white`.
- The entry in the Painting table `reduces` the amount of paint in the spray can by the specified volume column  
  and `increases` the amount of paint in the square by the same amount.
- The volume value should be in the range of` 0 < volume <= 255`.
- The amount of paint in a square of the `same color cannot exceed 255`, and  
  the amount of paint in a `spray can not be less than zero`.

## Example

_Square Table Example:_

| id | name    |
|----|---------|
| 1  | Square1 |
| 2  | Square2 |
| 3  | Square3 |
| 4  | Square4 |
| 5  | Square5 |

_Painting Table Example:_

| datetime            | square_id | spray_id | volume |
|---------------------|-----------|----------|--------|
| 2020-01-01 01:13:36 | 1         | 1        | 255    |
| 2020-01-01 02:13:36 | 1         | 2        | 255    |
| 2020-01-01 03:13:36 | 3         | 3        | 100    |
| 2020-01-01 04:13:36 | 3         | 3        | 155    |
| 2020-01-01 05:13:36 | 5         | 4        | 10     |

From the data presented in the table above, it is evident that `Squares` with ids `2` and `4` are those that  
do not participate in the painting process because they are absent in the `Painting` table. The output table,  
after identifying `Squares` that have never been painted, with the ordering of square names in **descending** order:

| id | name    |
|----|---------|
| 4  | Square4 |
| 2  | Square2 |


_From the output above, it can be seen that the order of the columns is `id`-> `name`_
